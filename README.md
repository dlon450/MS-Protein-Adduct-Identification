# MS-Protein-Adduct-Identification
Identification of protein adducts in deconvoluted mass spectrometry data by matching experimental peak distributions with potential isotope patterns. [Here](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13321-023-00797-7) is the corresponding paper.

## Getting Started
To access the web app, run the src/app.py file. 
```
python src/app.py
```
Otherwise, the search can be run directly using src/binding_site_search.py (changing file directories accordingly). 
```
python src/binding_site_search.py
```
Note that **deconvoluted** spectrum will be required as input (for the bound MS csv file).
